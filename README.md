# Y_EE_Sim
A simulation of the orbit of the earth for someone.

Install matplotlib and numpy along with python3
Run the files using cd and "python3 filename.py"

1. Sinusoidal equation: distance(t) = -1.00e+07 * sin(3.99e-07 * t + -1.58e+00) + 1.40e+08 (km)
2. Keep in mind that the lang_revised versions use time in seconds. the day_revised will return a function that inputs days
